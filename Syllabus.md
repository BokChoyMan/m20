# Syllabus

## Overview

This is a class about data structures. We'll talk about abstract data structures
like sequences,  heaps,  sets,  and maps;  the concrete data structures  used to
implement them; the performance of the concrete implementations;  and how to use
the abstract types to solve problems.

This is also a C++ class, but we won't focus too much on C++ syntax. You'll pick
that up  for yourselves  as you do the  programming assignments.  Come to office
hours or ask a Piazza question if you have language questions!


## Materials

Everything in this class is optional except the programming assignments. I don't
take attendance. Lecture notes will be available on GitHub. There is no required
reading. There is no textbook.  Everything we talk about in this class is common
computer science  material,  and you can find it  online in  whatever format you
like best.  If you prefer learning from textbooks, here are some possibilities:

- **Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++** by Michael Main and Walter Savitch\
  This was the required textbook for Diba Mirza'a CS 24 course in Spring 2020.
- **Problem Solving with C++** by Walter Savitch\
  This was a "recommended" textbook for the same CS 24 course.
- **Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in C++** by Mark Allen Weiss\
  This was the textbook for Ambuj Singh's CS 130A class in Spring 2019.


## Grading

Your entire grade  comes from programming assignments  (plus a handful of points
from surveys).  There will be  a total of ten  programming assignments  over the
quarter - one per week - all (roughly) equally weighted.  Expect  ten points per
survey and one hundred points per programming assignment.

I may  decide to curve the class;  if I do,  this will apply to  your cumulative
scores at the end of the quarter, and will only be in your favor. Getting 90% of
the possible points guarantees you at least an A-, 80% a B-, and so on.


## Coding

This is a C++ class,  so you'll be  coding in C++.  We'll use the  latest stable
version of the C++ standard, which is C++ 17, so make sure you compile your code
with the `-std=c++17` option.  Your code must compile with no warnings.  Use the
`-Wall`, `-Wextra`, and `-Werror` flags to enforce this.

Your assignments will be  auto-graded on Gradescope,  which is currently running
GCC 7.5.0 in Ubuntu 18.04.4 containers. Code written on other platforms may need
slight tweaking to compile correctly on Gradescope. In particular, Mac users may
need to include more header files.


## Piazza

We'll be using Piazza  as a general Q&A forum.  If you have a question you think
might apply to other people as well,  it's better to ask on Piazza  than to send
an email.

If you ask coding questions on Piazza, please:

- Post the smallest section of code that fully describes your problem.
- Include the code as a code snippet, not a screenshot or cell phone photo.
- If you include more than a few lines of your code, make your question private.


## Cheating

All assignments are individual assignments. Write your own code.  In fact, since
this is a  high-level class  where we talk about  abstract data structures,  you
should be able to discuss everything we do without ever sharing any code! If you
do decide to share code, keep in mind:

- **First Offence:** Zero on the assignment _and_ final grade lowered by one letter.
- **Second Offence:** Fail the class.

The programming assignments  are involved enough  that it's virtually impossible
for anyone to have the same code as you  by accident.  As long as you write your
own code you have nothing to worry about.
